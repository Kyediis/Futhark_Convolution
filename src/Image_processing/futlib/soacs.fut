-- | Various Second-Order Array Combinators that are operationally
-- parallel in a way that can be exploited by the compiler.
--
-- The functions here are all recognised specially by the compiler (or
-- built on those that are).  The asymptotic [work and
-- span](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_parallel_algorithms)
-- is provided for each function, but note that this easily hides very
-- substantial constant factors.  For example, `scan`@term is *much*
-- slower than `reduce`@term, although they have the same asymptotic
-- complexity.
--
-- *Reminder on terminology*: A function `op` is said to be
-- *associative* if
--
--     (x `op` y) `op` z == x `op` (y `op` z)
--
-- for all `x`, `y`, `z`.  Similarly, it is *commutative* if
--
--     x `op` y == y `op` x
--
-- The value `o` is a *neutral element* if
--
--     x `op` o == o `op` x == x
--
-- for any `x`.

-- | Reduce the array `as` with `op`, with `ne` as the neutral
-- element for `op`.  The function `op` must be associative.  If
-- it is not, the return value is unspecified.  If the value returned
-- by the operator is an array, it must have the exact same size as
-- the neutral element, and that must again have the same size as the

-- | `stream_red op f as` splits `as` into chunks, applies `f` to each

-- that has the same type and elements as `as`, except for the indices
-- in `is`.  If `is` contains duplicates (i.e. several writes are
-- performed to the same location), the result is unspecified.  It is
-- not guaranteed that one of the duplicate writes will complete
-- atomically - they may be interleaved.  See `reduce_by_index`@term
-- for a function that can handle this case deterministically.

-- This is technically not a second-order operation, but it is defined
-- here because it is closely related to the SOACs.
